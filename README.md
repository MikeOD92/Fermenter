#Fermenter

##an app for managing and collecting fermentation recipes

Fermenter is a MERN stack application made with
   
    MongoDB/Mongoose
    Express 
    React 
    Node.js

Fermenter currently has 3 models 
1. beers
2. salt fermentations/ lacto ferments
3. brew notes / logs 
   
   After getting some more of the functionality i want, i intened to add models for: vinegars, misos, cheese & lightly fermented bevrages (kombucha, Kvass...), maybe wine.

brew notes currently only work for the beers
both beer and lactoferments can be created, updated, read and deleted, 

### Forms

The forms will need to be refactored so that the app can have dynamic lists, right now the user is only able to add one main ingreident, spice, malt or hop. Forms need to be completly reworked and made dynamic. 
The user should be able to click a button adding a new form input for all ingredient keys that are arrays.

### Update/edit

this loads really slow, I need to figure out why
